    """Identify time shifts using the ruptures library.

    Compares the event time in the expected time zone (`reference_times`)
    with the actual event time in `event_times`.

    The Pelt changepoint detection method is applied to the difference
    between `event_times` and `reference_times`. For each period between
    change points the mode of the difference is rounded to a multiple of
    `shift_min` and returned as the time-shift for all days in that
    period.

    Parameters
    ----------
    event_times : Series
        Time of an event in minutes since midnight. Should be a time series
        of integers with a single value per day. Typically the time mid-way
        between sunrise and sunset.
    reference_times : Series
        Time of event in minutes since midnight for each day in the expected
        timezone. For example, passing solar transit time in a fixed offset
        time zone can be used to detect daylight savings shifts when it is
        unknown whether or not `event_times` is in a fixed offset time zone.
    period_min : int, default 2
        Minimum number of days between shifts. Must be less than or equal to
        the number of days in `event_times`. [days]

        Increasing this parameter will make the result less sensitive to
        transient shifts. For example if your intent is to find and correct
        daylight savings time shifts passing `period_min=60` can give good
        results while excluding shorter periods that appear shifted.
    shift_min : int, default 15
        Minimum shift amount in minutes. All shifts are rounded to a multiple
        of `shift_min`. [minutes]
    round_up_from : int, optional
        The number of minutes greater than a multiple of `shift_min` for a
        shift to be rounded up. If a shift is less than `round_up_from` then
        it will be rounded towards 0. If not specified then the shift will
        be rounded up from `shift_min // 2`. Using a larger value will
        effectively make the shift detection more conservative as small
        variations will tend to be rounded to zero. [minutes]
    prediction_penalty : int, default 13
        Penalty used in assessing change points.
        See :py:method:`ruptures.detection.Pelt.predict` for more information.

    Returns
    -------
    shifted : Series
        Boolean series indicating whether there appears to be a time
        shift on that day.
    shift_amount : Series
        Time shift in minutes for each day in `event_times`. These times
        can be used to shift the data into the same time zone as
        `reference_times`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the number of days in `event_times` is less than `period_min`.

    Notes
    -----
    Timestamped data from monitored PV systems may not always be localized
    to a consistent timezone. In some cases, data is timestamped with
    local time that may or may not be adjusted for daylight savings time
    transitions. This function helps detect issues of this sort, by
    detecting points where the time of some daily event (e.g. solar noon)
    changes significantly with respect to a reference time for the event.
    If the data's timestamps have not been adjusted for daylight savings
    transitions, the time of day at solar noon will change by roughly 60
    minutes in the days before and after the transition.

    To use this changepoint detection method to determine if your data's
    timestamps involve daylight savings transitions, first reduce your PV
    system data (irradiance or power) to a daily time series, with each
    point being the observed midday time in minutes. For example, if
    sunrise and sunset are inferred from the PV system data, the midday
    time can be inferred as the average of each day's sunrise and sunset
    time of day. To establish the expected midday time, calculate solar
    transit time in time of day. This function detects shifts in the
    difference between the observed and expected midday times, and
    returns (here I'm unclear what is being returned)
