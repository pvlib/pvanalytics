    """Identify time shifts using the ruptures library.

    Compares the solar-transit time from `clearsky_midday` with the
    mid-point between sunrise and sunset time derived from the `daytime`
    mask. These times are the times of the first and last True value on
    each day.

    The Pelt changepoint detection method is applied to the difference
    in midday times derived from the `daytime` series and the expected
    midday times from `clearsky_midday`. For each period between change
    points the mode of the difference is rounded to a multiple of
    `shift_min` and returned as the time-shift for all values in that
    period.

    Parameters
    ----------
    daytime : Series
        Boolean time-series with True for day and False for night.
    clearsky_midday : Series
        Time of midday in minutes for each day with no time shifts
        (i.e.based on solar position with a fixed-offset time zone).
    period_min : int, default 2
        Minimum number of days between shifts. Must be less than or equal to
        the number of days in `daytime`. [days]

        Increasing this parameter will make the result less sensitive to
        transient shifts. For example if your intent is to find and correct
        daylight savings time shifts passing `period_min=60` can give good
        results while excluding shorter periods that appear shifted.
    shift_min : int, default 15
        Minimum shift amount in minutes. All shifts are rounded to a multiple
        of `shift_min`. [minutes]
    round_up_from : int, optional
        The number of minutes greater than a multiple of `shift_min` for a
        shift to be rounded up. If a shift is less than `round_up_from` then
        it will be rounded towards 0. If not specified then the shift will
        be rounded up from `shift_min // 2`. Using a larger value will
        effectively make the shift detection more conservative as small
        variations will tend to be rounded to zero. [minutes]
    prediction_penalty : int, default 13
        Penalty used in assessing change points.
        See :py:method:`ruptures.detection.Pelt.predict` for more information.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Time shift in minutes at each timestamp in `daytime`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the number of days in `daytime` is less than `period_min`.
