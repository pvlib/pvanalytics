    """Determine system azimuth and tilt from power or POA using solar
    azimuth at the daily peak.

    The time of the daily peak is estimated by fitting a quadratic to
    to the data for each day in `power_or_poa` and finding the vertex
    of the fit. A brute force search is performed on clearsky POA
    irradiance for all pairs of candidate azimuths and tilts
    (`azimuths` and `tilts`) to find the pair that results in the
    closest azimuth to the azimuths calculated at the peak times from
    the curve fitting step. Closest is determined by minimizing the
    sum of squared difference between the solar azimuth at the peak
    time in `power_or_poa` and the solar azimuth at maximum clearsky
    POA irradiance.

    The accuracy of the tilt and azimuth returned by this function will
    vary with the time-resolution of the clearsky and solar position
    data. For the best accuracy pass `solar_azimuth`, `solar_zenith`,
    and the clearsky data (`ghi`, `dhi`, and `dni`) with one-minute
    timestamp spacing. If `solar_azimuth` has timestamp spacing less
    than one minute it will be resampled and interpolated to estimate
    azimuth at each minute of the day. Regardless of the timestamp
    spacing these parameters must cover the same days as
    `power_or_poa`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    power_or_poa : Series
        Timezone localized series of power or POA irradiance
        measurements.
    sunny : Series
        Boolean series with True for values during clearsky
        conditions.
    tilts : array-like
        Candidate tilts in degrees.
    azimuths : array-like
        Candidate azimuths in degrees.
    solar_azimuth : Series
        Time series of solar azimuth.
    solar_zenith : Series
        Time series of solar zenith.
    ghi : Series
        Clear sky GHI.
    dhi : Series
        Clear sky DHI.
    dni : Series
        Clear sky DNI.
