    """Flag days that match the profile of a single-axis tracking PV system
    on a sunny day.

    This algorithm relies on the observation that the power profile of
    a single-axis tracking PV system tends to resemble a quartic
    polynomial on a sunny day, I.e., two peaks are observed, one
    before and one after the sun crosses the tracker azimuth. By
    contrast, the power profile for a fixed tilt PV system often
    resembles a quadratic polynomial on a sunny day, with a single
    peak when the sun is near the system azimuth.

    The algorithm fits both a quartic and a quadratic polynomial to
    each day's data.  A day is marked True if the quartic fit has a
    sufficiently high :math:`r^2` and the quadratic fit has a
    sufficiently low :math:`r^2`.  Specifically, a day is marked True
    when three conditions are met:

    1. a restricted quartic [#]_ must fit the data with :math:`r^2`
       greater than `r2_min`
    2. the :math:`r^2` for the restricted quartic fit must be greater
       than the :math:`r^2` for a quadratic fit
    3. the :math:`r^2` for a quadratic fit must be less than
       `r2_fixed_max`

    Values on days where any one of these conditions is not met are
    marked False.

    .. [#] The specific quartic used for this fit is centered within
       70 minutes of 12:00, the y-value at the center must be within
       15% of the median for the day, and it must open downwards.

    Parameters
    ----------
    power_or_irradiance : Series
        Timezone localized series of power or irradiance measurements.
    daytime : Series
        Boolean series with True for times that are during the
        day. For best results this mask should exclude early morning
        and late afternoon as well as night. Data at these times may have
        problems with shadows that interfere with curve fitting.
    r2_min : float, default 0.915
        Minimum :math:`r^2` of a quartic fit for a day to be marked True.
    r2_fixed_max : float, default 0.96
        If the :math:`r^2` of a quadratic fit exceeds
        `r2_fixed_max`, then tracking/fixed cannot be distinguished
        and the day is marked False.
    min_hours : float, default 5.0
        Minimum number of hours with data to attempt a fit on a day.
    peak_min : float, default None
        The maximum `power_or_irradiance` value for a day must be
        greater than `peak_min` for a fit to be attempted. If the
        maximum for a day is less than `peak_min` then the day will be
        marked False.
    quadratic_mask : Series, default None
        If None then `daytime` is used. This Series is used to remove
        morning and afternoon times from the data before applying a
        quadratic fit. The mask should
        typically exclude more data than `daytime` in order to
        eliminate long tails in the morning or afternoon that can
        appear if a tracker is stuck in a West or East orientation.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Boolean series with True for every value on a day that has a
        tracking profile (see criteria above).
