    """Detect clipping based on a maximum power threshold.

    This is a two-step process. First a clipping threshold is
    identified, then any values in `ac_power` greater than or equal to
    that threshold are flagged.

    The clipping threshold is determined by computing a 'daily power
    curve' which is the `power_quantile` quantile of all values in
    `ac_power` at each minute of the day. This gives a rough estimate
    of the maximum power produced at each minute of the day.

    The daily power curve is normalized by its maximum and the minutes
    of the day are identified where the normalized curve's slope is
    less than `slope_max`. If there is a continuous period of time
    spanning at least one hour where the slope is less than
    `slope_max` and the value of the normalized daily power curve is
    greater than `power_min` times the median of the normalized daily
    power curve then the data has clipping in it. If no sufficiently
    long period with both a low slope and high power exists then there
    is no clipping in the data.  The average of the daily power curve
    (not normalized) during the longest period that satisfies the
    criteria above is the clipping threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ac_power : Series
        DatetimeIndexed series of AC power data.
    slope_max : float, default 0.0035
        Maximum absolute value of slope of AC power quantile for
        clipping to be indicated. The default value has been derived
        empirically to prevent false positives for tracking PV
        systems.
    power_min: float, default 0.75
        The power during periods with slope less than `slope_max` must
        be greater than `power_min` times the median normalized
        daytime power.
    power_quantile : float, default 0.995
        Quantile used to calculate the daily power curve.
    freq : string, default None
        A pandas string offset giving the frequency of data in
        `ac_power`. If None then the frequency is inferred from the
        series index.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        True when `ac_power` is greater than or equal to the clipping
        threshold.
