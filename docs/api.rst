Irradiance
----------

The ``check_*_limits_qcrad`` functions use the QCRad algorithm [1]_ to
identify irradiance measurements that are beyond physical limits.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.irradiance.check_ghi_limits_qcrad
   quality.irradiance.check_dhi_limits_qcrad
   quality.irradiance.check_dni_limits_qcrad

All three checks can be combined into a single function call.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.irradiance.check_irradiance_limits_qcrad

Irradiance measurements can also be checked for consistency.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.irradiance.check_irradiance_consistency_qcrad

GHI and POA irradiance can be validated against clearsky values to
eliminate data that is unrealistically high.

   quality.irradiance.clearsky_limits

Gaps
----

Identify gaps in the data.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.gaps.interpolation_diff

Outliers
--------

Functions for detecting outliers.

.. autosummary::

Time
----

Quality control related to time. This includes things like time-stamp
spacing, time-shifts, and time zone validation.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.time.spacing

Weather
-------

Quality checks for weather data.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.weather.relative_humidity_limits
   quality.weather.temperature_limits
   quality.weather.wind_limits

Features
========

Functions for detecting features in the data.

Clipping
--------

Functions for identifying inverter clipping
